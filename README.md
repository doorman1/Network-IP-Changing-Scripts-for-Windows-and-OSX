Network IP Changing Scripts for Windows and OSX.

These are just simple .cmd files (or .command files in the case of OSX) that will change your IP for whichever interface you want. It's really simple, but you'd be surprised how often I use these. They come very in handy.

And there's a REVERT.cmd (or .command for OSX) for each folder that will put whichever interface you just changed back to whatever state it was before.

If you're a networking guy like me, set these up to some hotkeys on your keyboard, and configuring devices just got a hell of a lot easier.

Enjoy!
